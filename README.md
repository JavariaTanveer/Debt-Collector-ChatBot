### Debt Collector Chatbot

This project aims to create a **chatbot** that handles debt collection conversations with users. The chatbot leverages advanced **AI models** to provide conversational responses in the context of debt collection.

###  Key Features & Workflow

1. **Model Setup**:

   * The **Llama-3.1-70b-versatile** model is used for generating natural language responses. It is a large-scale language model optimized for versatility in various tasks.

2. **API Integration**:

   * The chatbot communicates with the **Groq** platform through an API key. This setup allows the application to make requests to Groq's hosted models.

3. **Groq API**:

   * The Groq platform handles interactions between the chatbot and the language model. The API is responsible for sending data to the model, which generates a response based on the user's input.

4. **Debt Collection Focus**:

   * While the notebook doesn't provide full details on the specific functionality of the chatbot, the focus is on using conversational AI to assist in debt collection, which may include generating responses about debt amounts, payment schedules, reminders, or negotiations.

###  Technologies Used:

* **Groq**: A platform for deploying and interacting with AI models.
* **Llama-3.1-70b-versatile**: A state-of-the-art language model for conversational AI tasks.
* **API Integration**: For smooth communication between the chatbot and the backend services.
