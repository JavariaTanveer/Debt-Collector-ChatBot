You can pay 50% of the total amount now, which would be $250.37, and the remaining 50% can be paid in 3 months. Would this payment plan work for you?\n",

            "Assistant: If you're not comfortable with the Credit Payment Method, we do have an alternative option. You can use the Online Bank Transfer method to pay the initial 50% of $250.37. Would you prefer to proceed with the Online Bank Transfer method instead?\n",
